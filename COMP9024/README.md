##Data Structures and Algorithms

- Course Summary

	 Data structures are about how data are stored inside a computer. An algorithm is a step-by-step process for solving a problem within 
	a finite amount of time.  Data structures and algorithms are not important in software design, but also in hardware design. Being
	proficient in data structures and algorithms are essential for good software developers, hardware developers, and system architects.
